# Unnecessary Closing Tag for &lt;br&gt; Element

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: using a closing tag for the `<br>` (line break) element.  The `<br>` element is self-closing and does not require a closing tag.  The presence of the closing tag (`</br>`) is invalid HTML and may cause unexpected behavior in some browsers.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the correct way to use the `<br>` tag.
